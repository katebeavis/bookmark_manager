# Bookmark Manager

Bookmark Manager was our week four project at Makers Academy. We had to create a site where a user could store bookmarks, each of which could be associated with tags.

**This project is still under construction.**

## Objectives

This was our first taste of SQL, databases and ORM. I learnt how to manipulate a postgreSQL database directly from the command line, and how to create 'user management' - signing a user up, logging them in and out etc.

## Technology
- Ruby
- Sinatra
- PostgreSQL
- Datamapper
- Bcrypt
- Rack Flash
- Capybara
- Rspec
